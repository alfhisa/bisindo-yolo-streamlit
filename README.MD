## Run Locally

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/alfhisa/bisindo-yolo-streamlit.git
cd bisindo-yolo-streamlit
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Add model file

Place your `best.pt` file (YOLOv11 trained weights) in the root directory.

### 4. Run Streamlit app

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Model

Trained using YOLOv11 on a custom BISINDO sign dataset.  
Supports **A-Z** hand gesture detection.

> Want to train your own? Use [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com) and label your dataset in YOLO format.

---

## Deployment

This app is fully compatible with [Streamlit Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud).

Just push your repo and model, and it runs in the browser!

## 📷 Troubleshooting Webcam

If webcam fails to load:
- Make sure your browser gives camera access
- Use Google Chrome or Firefox (Safari might block WebRTC)
- Ensure no other app is using webcam
- If deployed: Check STUN server and firewall
